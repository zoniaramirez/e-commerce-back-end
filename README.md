# E-Commerce Back End

This E-Commerce Back End application was created using the latest technologies. Using the latest technologies will allow an internet retail company to compete with other e-commerce companies in the marker.

## Description

This E-Commerce Back End was created as a challenge for bootcamp students to apply everything that was learned in module 13 of class. The challenge will connect the Express.js API to a PostgresSQL database. It will use the dotenv package to use environment variables to store sensitive data. tThe application will be invoked by using the `` node server.js `` or `` npm start `` command. This app functionality will be achieved by using the Sequelize an pg package.

## Acceptance Criteria

    - Having a source code
    - Given a functional Express.js API
    - When I add my database name, PostgreSQL username, and PostgreSQL password to an environment variable file
    - Then I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
    - When I enter schema and seed commands a development database is created and is seeded with test data
    - When I enter the command to invoke the application my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the PostgreSQL database
    - When I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
    - When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
